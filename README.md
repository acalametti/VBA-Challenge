# VBA-Challenge
By Alex Calametti

Overview: 
  In this project, I used VBA scripting in Excel to analyze the provided stock market data spanning over three separate years. This project includes the script I created as well as screenshots of the final results. 

  Part 1: Creating the code
    First I began by creating the variables needed to analyze the stock market data. Then I created a For loop to summarize the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for each Ticker. Then another loop was created to apply the script to each worksheet in the workbook.


Part 2: Summary Table
  Lastly, the greatest percent increase, decrease, and total stock volume were calculated using the MAX function and the corresponding ticker was found using the VLOOKUP function.

Big thanks to Randy for providing insight on how to reset the different variables in the code during office hours. Also, thanks to BCS Learning Assistant Dihn for helping me debug the section of my code to select the open amount to calculate the yearly change.
